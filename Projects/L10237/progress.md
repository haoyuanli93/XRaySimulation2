# Some conclusions for the simulation at this moment
1. The auto-alignment cannot be done for the first grating. It is simply too challenging
    a. Need to calculate the electric field in the momentum space.
    b. Need to switch the 3 electric field together in the real space. 
    c. Anyway, it is simply too challenging to make this to be true.
2. Need to change the axis convention in the simulation to make it compatible with that of XPP hutch

3. Need to implement the interpulation
